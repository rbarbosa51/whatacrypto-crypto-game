                  <p>In the interface panel, you will see the current value being displayed every second. Below that you will see the Buys Remaining Label. This will let you know how many purchases you can currently make. The game starts with 10. Next to it you will see the Buy Stack Number. As you purchase units the value of the Buys Remaining will decrease and the number in the Buy Stack will increase by one. Next to the Buy Stack is the Score Label. This will let you know in real time how much you have made (or lost).</p>

                <p>A great strategy to follow in this game is to play how you would in real life; buy low and sell high. As per the screenshot, you can see that a really good time to buy would be at around 5 seconds, and a really good time to sell would have been at approximately 30 seconds into the game if you can react fast enough. Part of this game is also luck-based. The line can take an unexpected turn at any point and you might not hit the buy or sell button fast enough at the exact point that you wanted to so it is good to have some level of anticipation and practice what perople do in the real world; taking risks.</p>
